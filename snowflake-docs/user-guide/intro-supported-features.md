# Overview of key features

This topic lists the notable and significant features supported in the current release. It *doesn’t* list every feature provided
by Snowflake.

  + [Window functions](../sql-reference/functions-window).
  + [Grouping sets](../sql-reference/constructs/group-by).
* Scalar and tabular [user-defined functions (UDFs)](../developer-guide/udf/udf-overview), with support for Java, JavaScript,
  Python, Scala, and SQL.
* [Stored procedures](../developer-guide/stored-procedure/stored-procedures-overview) and procedural language support
  ([Snowflake Scripting](../developer-guide/snowflake-scripting/index))
* [Snowflake Information Schema](../sql-reference/info-schema) for querying object and account metadata, as well as query and warehouse usage history data.
* Recursive queries, including:

  + [CONNECT BY](../sql-reference/constructs/connect-by).
  + [Recursive CTE (common table expressions)](../sql-reference/constructs/with).
* [Collation support](../sql-reference/collation).
* [Geospatial data support](../sql-reference/data-types-geospatial).

## Tools and interfaces

* [Snowsight](ui-snowsight-quick-tour) for account and general management, monitoring of resources and system usage, and
  querying data.
* [Snowflake CLI (open source command-line client)](../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index).

## Apps and extensibility

* [APIs for Java, Python, and Scala](../developer-guide/snowpark/index) with which you can build applications that process data in
  Snowflake without moving data to the system where your application code runs.
* A [framework for creating applications](../developer-guide/native-apps/native-apps-about)
  to share data content and application logic with other Snowflake accounts.
* A [RESTful API](../developer-guide/sql-api/index) for accessing and updating data.
* Support for running [Streamlit apps natively in Snowflake](../developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit)

  + Load any data that uses a supported character encoding.
  + Load data from compressed files.
  + Load most flat, delimited data files (CSV, TSV, etc.).
  + Load data files in JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet, and XML format.
  + Load from files in cloud storage or local files using the Snowflake web interface or command-line client.
* Support for continuous data loading from files:

  + Use [Snowpipe](data-load-snowpipe-intro) to load data in micro-batches from internal (i.e. Snowflake) stages or external
    (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure) stages.
* Support for accessing data in [S3-compatible storage](data-load-s3-compatible-storage).

## Data sharing

  + Replicate objects between Snowflake accounts (within the same organization) and keep the objects and stored data synchronized.
  + Configure failover to one or more Snowflake accounts for business continuity and disaster recovery.
