# Snowflake editions

Snowflake offers multiple editions to choose from, ensuring that your usage fits your organization’s specific requirements. Each successive
edition builds on the previous edition through the addition of edition-specific features and/or higher levels of service. As your
organization’s needs change and grow, changing editions is easy.

For information about working with editions, including viewing and changing an account’s edition, see [Working with account editions](organizations-manage-accounts-editions).

Note

The Snowflake Edition that your organization chooses determines the unit costs for the credits and the data storage you use. Other factors
that impact unit costs are the [region](intro-regions) where your Snowflake account is located and whether it is
an *On Demand* or *Capacity* account:

* On Demand: Usage-based pricing with no long-term licensing requirements.
* Capacity: Discounted pricing based on an upfront Capacity commitment.

For pricing details, see the [pricing page](http://www.snowflake.com/pricing) (on the Snowflake website).

## Overview of editions

### Standard Edition

Standard Edition is our introductory level offering, providing full, unlimited access to all of Snowflake’s standard features. It provides
a strong balance between features, level of support, and cost.

### Enterprise Edition

Enterprise Edition provides all the features and services of [Standard Edition](#label-snowflake-editions-standard), with additional features
that are designed specifically for the needs of large-scale enterprises and organizations.

### Business Critical Edition

Business Critical Edition, formerly known as Enterprise for Sensitive Data (ESD), offers even higher levels of data protection to support
the needs of organizations with extremely sensitive data, particularly PHI data that must comply with HIPAA and
[HITRUST CSF](intro-cloud-platforms.html#label-hitrust-csf-cert) regulations.

It includes all the features and services of [Enterprise Edition](#label-snowflake-editions-enterprise), with the addition of enhanced security and data
protection. In addition, account failover/failback adds support for business continuity and disaster recovery.

Note

As required by HIPAA and [HITRUST CSF](intro-cloud-platforms.html#label-hitrust-csf-cert) regulations, before any PHI data can be stored in Snowflake, a
signed business associate agreement (BAA) must be in place between your agency/organization and Snowflake Inc.

### Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS)

Virtual Private Snowflake offers our highest level of security for organizations that have the strictest requirements, such as financial
institutions and any other large enterprises that collect, analyze, and share highly sensitive data.

It includes all the features and services of [Business Critical Edition](#label-snowflake-editions-business-critical), but in a completely separate Snowflake
environment, isolated from all other Snowflake accounts (i.e. VPS accounts do not share any type of hardware resources with accounts outside the VPS).

Note

To access your account, you can use an [account identifier](admin-account-identifier) that specifies your
organization name and account name.

If you instead choose to use an [account locator](admin-account-identifier.html#label-account-locator) as the account identifier, note that
the account locator for VPS accounts uses a different format than the accounts for other Snowflake Editions. For details, see
[Finding the account locator format for a VPS account](admin-account-identifier.html#label-account-identifier-for-vps).

## Find your current edition

You can find the Snowflake edition for your account in the following ways:

* To find your Snowflake edition by using Snowsight, follow the instructions in
  [Locate your Snowflake account information in Snowsight](ui-snowsight-gs.html#label-snowsight-account-details).
* To find your Snowflake edition by using SQL, query the
  [ACCOUNTS view](../sql-reference/organization-usage/accounts) in the ORGANIZATION\_USAGE schema,
  and select the `edition` column:

  CopyExpand

  ```
  SELECT edition
    FROM SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.ACCOUNTS
    WHERE account_name = CURRENT_ACCOUNT();
  ```

  Show lessSee more

  Scroll to top

  To query this view, you must have [access to the ORGANIZATION\_USAGE schema](../sql-reference/organization-usage.html#label-org-usage-schema-access).

## Feature and edition matrix

The following tables provide a list of the major features and services included with each edition.

Note

This is only a partial list of the features. For a more complete and detailed list, see [Overview of key features](intro-supported-features).
